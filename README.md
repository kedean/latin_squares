Latin Squares Generator

Small set of functions to create latin squares.

=============

Latin squares are NxN grids of n distinct symbols. The squares produced here are digits of 0 through the dimension number, and exactly n squares are produced (a cube of values). Running the latin_squares.py file will run a test script that takes in a dimension and produces random squares to match it.

Note that latin squares of dimension < 4 are considered invalid, as not enough permutations of 3 exist to fill the cube fully.
